Acknowledgement \nThe design of this website is based on  Computational Thinking , a live online Julia/Pluto textbook. (computationalthinking.mit.edu) Build your own course website using https://github.com/greimel/pluto-course-template"},{"url":"installation/","title":"Software installation","tags":["welcome"],"text":"First-time setup: Install Julia & Pluto Video version: Text and pictures version: Step 1: Install Julia  1.8.2 Go to  https://julialang.org/downloads  and download the current stable release, Julia  1.8.2 , using the correct version for your operating system (Linux x86, Mac, Windows, etc). Step 2: Run Julia After installing,  make sure that you can run Julia . On some systems, this means searching for the “Julia  1.8.2 ” program installed on your computer; in others, it means running the command  julia  in a terminal. Make sure that you can execute  1 + 1 : Make sure that you are able to launch Julia and calculate  1+1  before proceeding! Step 3: Install  Pluto Next we will install the  Pluto , the notebook environment that we will be using during the course. Pluto is a Julia  programming environment  designed for interactivity and quick experiments. Open the  Julia REPL . This is the command-line interface to Julia, similar to the previous screenshot. Here you type  Julia commands , and when you press ENTER, it runs, and you see the result. To install Pluto, we want to run a  package manager command . To switch from  Julia  mode to  Pkg  mode, type  ]  (closing square bracket) at the  julia>  prompt: \njulia> ]\n\n(@v 1.8 ) pkg>\n The line turns blue and the prompt changes to  pkg> , telling you that you are now in  package manager mode . This mode allows you to do operations on  packages  (also called libraries). To install Pluto, run the following (case sensitive) command to  add  (install) the package to your system by downloading it from the internet.\nYou should only need to do this  once  for each installation of Julia: \n(@v 1.8 ) pkg> add Pluto\n This might take a couple of minutes, so you can go get yourself a cup of tea! You can now close the terminal. Step 4: Use a modern browser: Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome We need a modern browser to view Pluto notebooks with. Firefox and Chrome work best. Second time:  Running Pluto & opening a notebook Repeat the following steps whenever you want to work on a project or homework assignment. Step 1: Start Pluto Start the Julia REPL, like you did during the setup. In the REPL, type: julia> using Pluto\n\njulia> Pluto.run()\n The terminal tells us to go to  http://localhost:1234/  (or a similar URL). Let’s open Firefox or Chrome and type that into the address bar. If you’re curious about what a  Pluto notebook  looks like, have a look at the  Featured Notebooks . These notebooks are useful for learning some basics of Julia programming. If you want to hear the story behind Pluto, have a look a the  JuliaCon presentation . If nothing happens in the browser the first time, close Julia and try again. And please let us know! Step 2a: Opening a notebook from the web This is the main menu - here you can create new notebooks, or open existing ones. Our homework assignments will always be based on a  template notebook , available in this GitHub repository. To start from a template notebook on the web, you can  paste the URL into the blue box  and press ENTER. For example, homework 0 is available  here . Go to this page, and on the top right, click on the button that says “Edit or run this notebook”. From these instructions, copy the notebook link, and paste it into the box. Press ENTER, and select OK in the confirmation box. The first thing we will want to do is to save the notebook somewhere on our own computer; see below. Step 2b: Opening an existing notebook file When you launch Pluto for the second time, your recent notebooks will appear in the main menu. You can click on them to continue where you left off. If you want to run a local notebook file that you have not opened before, then you need to enter its  full path  into the blue box in the main menu. More on finding full paths in step 3. Step 3: Saving a notebook We first need a folder to save our homework in. Open your file explorer and create one. Next, we need to know the  absolute path  of that folder. Here’s how you do that in  Windows ,  MacOS  and  Ubuntu . For example, you might have: C:\\Users\\fons\\Documents\\18S191_assignments\\  on Windows /Users/fons/Documents/18S191_assignments/  on MacOS /home/fons/Documents/18S191_assignments/  on Ubuntu Now that we know the absolute path, go back to your Pluto notebook, and at the top of the page, click on  “Save notebook…” . This is where you type the  new path+filename for your notebook : Click  Choose . Step 4: Sharing a notebook After working on your notebook (your code is autosaved when you run it), you will find your notebook file in the folder we created in step 3. This the file that you can share with others, or submit as your homework assignment to Canvas. \nconst run = f => f();\nrun(async () => {\nconst versions = await (await fetch(`https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/versions.json`)).json()\nconst version_names = Object.keys(versions).sort().reverse()\nconst stable = version_names.find(v => versions[v].stable)\nconsole.log({stable})\nconst pkg_stable = /\\d+\\.\\d+/.exec(stable)[0]\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"auto-julia-version\").forEach(el => {\n    console.log(el)\n    el.innerText = el.getAttribute(\"short\") == null ? stable : pkg_stable\n})\n});"},{"url":"search/","title":"Search results","tags":[],"text":"window.init_search(); Search Results \nLoading..."},{"url":"sidebar data/","title":"sidebar data","tags":[],"text":"Dict main \"welcome\" collections \"welcome\" .pages, \"Julia basics\" collections \"julia basics\" .pages, \"Preliminaries\" collections \"preliminaries\" .pages, \"Housing\" collections \"housing\" .pages, \"Long run\" collections \"long run\" .pages, \"Continuous time\" collections \"continuous time\" .pages, \"Assignments and Tutorials\" collections \"assignments\" .pages, , about Dict authors name \"Fabian Greimel\", url \"https www.greimel.eu\" , name \"Enrico Perotti\", url \"https www.enricoperotti.eu\" , title \"Topics in Distributional Macroeconomics\", subtitle \"PhD level Elective Course\", term \"Spring 2024\", institution \"Tinbergen Institute\", institution url \"http www.tinbergen.nl\", institution logo \"tinbergen institute logo.svg\", institution logo darkmode \"tinbergen logo white.svg\" "},{"url":"syllabus/","title":"Syllabus","tags":["welcome"],"text":"Syllabus Course Links official Canvas course page Class schedule Lecture Title Date Lecturer Notebooks Reading 1A Network Basics 1 Feb  7, 2022 Cees basic Julia ,  first networks Jackson Ch. 1 & 2 1B Network Basics 2 Feb 10, 2022 Cees coauthor network ,  power law ,  exercises Jackson Ch. 3 1C Random Networks Feb 11, 2022 Cees notebook Jackson Ch. 4–6 & 11 2A Tutorial 1: Twitter Feb 14, 2022 Cees notebook 2B Learning on Networks Feb 17, 2022 Cees notebook Jackson Ch. 8 2C Disease Transmission Feb 18, 2022 Cees notebook 3A no lecture Feb 21, 2022 3B Financial networks 1 Feb 24, 2022 Fabian notebook Allen & Gale (2000) 3C Financial networks 2 Feb 25, 2022 Fabian notebook Acemoglu et al.

This is a system of 2N a linear equations. Since v^ n 1 is implicitly defined by the equations above, this approach is referred to as the implicit method.

Below you can see an alternative way of creating named tuples that is frequently used in the course material \"\"\" let a 1 named tuple2 a, b 2 a is equivalent to a a end md\"\"\" Keyword arguments A similar syntax with a semicolon is used for keyword arguments that are identified by name and not by their position as normal function arguments \"\"\" function some function a, b 1 return a b end some function a 3, b 5 let a 3 some function a, b 5 a is equivalent to a a end md\"\"\" Vectorization with dot syntax You can apply a function to all elements of a vector by using the dot syntax \"\"\" 1,2,3 .^ 2 log. 1,2,3 md\"\"\" Note how Julia usually does things in a way that's mathematically consistent. Look at the following code. \"\"\" A ones 3, 3 exp A exp. A A^2 A .^ 2 md\"\"\" What would Python, R or Matlab do? \"\"\" md\"\"\" The pipe operator The pipe operator | makes it possible to write down nested function calls in a more readable way. For example, the two expressions below do the same thing \"\"\" round log named tuple.b named tuple.b | log | round md\"\"\" In case you use R The | operator in Julia is similar to the % % operator in R. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Unicode characters You can use Greek letters and other Unicode characters in your Julia code. For example, type \"\\alpha\" in the cell below without the quotation marks and press Tab on your keyboard. This should create an \\alpha symbol. \"\"\" md\"\"\" See the Julia documention https docs.julialang.org en v1 manual unicode input for a list of supported Unicode characters. For Greek letters, the abbreviations are the same as in LaTeX. \"\"\" md\"\"\" The \\in symbol An elegant way of writing loops is to use the \\in symbol instead of writing \"in\". The \\in symbol can be created by typing \"\\in\" and pressing Tab. \"\"\" i^2 for i ∈ 1 5 md\"\"\" Working with data Here are a few simple examples of working with DataFrames in Julia. If you are familiar with pandas, dplyr or Stata, have a look at this cheatsheet https dataframes.juliadata.org stable man comparisons . Also, have a look at the documentation of DataFrameMacros.jl https jkrumbiegel.github.io DataFrameMacros.jl stable which makes working with DataFrames much more convenient. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Creating a `DataFrame` \"\"\" df1 DataFrame x 1 10 md\"\"\" Transforming mutating a column \"\"\" transform df1, x ByRow x sqrt x transform df1, sqrt x uses transform from DataFrameMacros.jl md\"\"\" The ``` chain``` macro \"\"\" md\"\"\" The ``` chain``` macro works similar to the pipe operator. In the code for this course, the ``` chain``` macro is often applied to data frames together with macros from the ```DataFrameMacros``` package. \"\"\" df2 DataFrame A 1,2,2,1 , B randn 4 md\"\"\" Consider the data frame above. Let's say you would like to add up the values in the B column separately for each value of A take the absolute value of the resulting sums of B values. Using the ``` chain``` macro, we can perform this task with relatively concise code \"\"\" chain df2 begin groupby A combine sum B , automatically named C sum B specify name transform abs C end md\"\"\" Without the ``` chain``` macro, the code would look like this \"\"\" begin df groups groupby df2, A df sum combine df groups, sum B , C sum B transform df sum, abs C end md\"\"\" Pluto notebooks General advice Press F1 to see shortcuts for Pluto notebooks. Ctrl Click on an underlined variable or function to jump to its definition. Use the Live docs in the bottom right corner to get more information about any Julia function or object. Check the Github wiki https github.com fonsp Pluto.jl wiki for more information on Pluto notebooks. Automated updating of cells When changing a function or variable, Pluto automatically updates all affected cells. For example, change the value of d to some other number and see how the following cell updates automatically \"\"\" d 5 d 10 md\"\"\" This is different from jupyter notebooks in which you have to update related cells manually. The automated updating the advantage that you do not have to keep in mind the order in which to evaluate cells. However, it can also be annoying if some of the affected cells take a long time to run. At the time of writing, there is no way to turn off the automated updating but you can always manually disable cells with long run times by clicking on the three dots in the top right corner of a cell. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Only one expression per cell Pluto notebooks only allow one expression per cell. If you nevertheless want to place several expressions into the same cell, you have to use a begin ... end block \"\"\" begin e 10 f e 5 end md\"\"\" Cannot reuse variable names \"\"\" md\"\"\" Use `let` blocks to specify variable names locally. \"\"\" let g 3 end g md\"\"\" Deactivate cells \"\"\" ╠═╡ sleep 5 ╠═╡ md\"\"\" Imported Packages \"\"\" TableOfContents g 1 g 2 "},{"url":"long-run/comparisons/","title":"Has Rising Inequality Fueled the American Debt Boom?","tags":["long-run"],"text":" A Pluto.jl notebook v0.19.38 frontmatter chapter 5 section 1 order 1 title \"Has Rising Inequality Fueled the American Debt Boom?\" layout \"layout.jlhtml\" tags \"long run\" description \"\" using Markdown using InteractiveUtils This Pluto notebook uses bind for interactivity.

The resulting equilibrium interest rate is round r eq, digits 4 and the associated capital stock is round k eq, digits 3 . \"\"\" wto target 3.63 md\" Calibrating the discount factor \\beta Now, let's choose the discount factor \\beta such that the wealth to output ratio K F K,N matches the US value of round wto target, digits 3 Auclert and Rognlie, 'Inequality and Aggregate Demand', Appendix B .

Give at least 2 reasons. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Answer Direct transfers to individuals during recessions such as the Economic Impact Payments in the US are only an effective stimulus policy if the MPC of these individuals is high. MPCs are important for the effects of wide set of economic policies on consumption and output, e.g. tax reforms, government spending, and monetary policy. MPC heterogeneity matters if these policies affect some households more than others. Different consumption savings models make very different predictions about the average MPC and MPC heterogeneity. Therefore, empirical evidence can help to distinguish between competing theories. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Model parameters \"\"\" r 0.03 prices q 1 1 r , w 1.0 z chain MarkovChain 0.75 0.25 0.25 0.75 , 1.25, 0.75 k vals range 0., 5., length 500 md\"\"\" Exercise 2 No income risk 2 points As a first step, let's consider a more simple model without income risk and without the ad hoc borrowing constraint k t\\ge 0 . 👉 Derive an analytical formula for the MPC and plug in the model parameters given above. 👉 What can you say about the average MPC and MPC heterogeneity in this model? \"\"\" md\"\"\" Solution to the households' problem The case with income risk and the ad hoc borrowing constraint does not have an analytical solution. Therefore, we solve the households' problem using functions from the ```aiygari.jl``` notebook \"\"\" md\"\"\" The consumption policy that we obtain from the ```QuantEcon``` solver has small jumps. This is not an actual property of the policy function but happens because we have only solved a discretized version of the households' problem. You can check for yourself that the size of the jumps decreases as you increase the number of grid points. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Since we will use the slope of the policy function to analyze the MPC, the jumps are very inconvenient. Therefore, you will work with the smoothed version of the consumption policy which is saved in the ```c sm``` column of the ```results2``` data frame. \"\"\" md\"\"\" The figure below shows both the raw consumption function and its smoothed version \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 3 MPCs in the Aiyagari model \"\"\" md\"\"\" 3a Compute MPCs 1.5 points 👉 Use the smoothed consumption policy to compute the MPC at each point of the state space. Save the MPC values in an additional column of the results data frame. Hint It is most convenient to consider a transitory income shock of the size dx 1 r \\Delta k where \\Delta k is the distance between two adjacent grid points. \"\"\" md\"\"\" The algorithm cannot compute the MPC at the right most grid point and sets it to zero. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 3b Average MPC 1 point 👉 What is the average MPC in the Aiyagari model for the given parameters? \"\"\" md\"\"\" 3c MPC heterogeneity 3 points 👉 Explore MPC heterogeneity in the Aiyagari model graphically. 👉 How much do MPCs vary in the population? Which households have particularly high MPCs? \"\"\" md\"\"\" Answer The histogram shows that the majority of households has an MPC of about 0.1. A considerable fraction of households has much higher MPCs close to 1. \"\"\" md\"\"\" The figure below shows the MPC as a function of assets and the income state. All high MPC households are in the low income state and at or close to the borrowing constraint k 0 . The wiggles in the MPC for high asset levels k\\ge 2 indicate that the bandwidth that we used for smoothing out the jumps is too small in this area of the state space. However, this does not matter much for our analysis of MPC heterogeneity because there are barely any households with k\\ge 2 . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 4 Outlook 1.5 points The empirical literature on MPCs typically finds average annual MPCs in the range 30 50% Jappelli and Pistaferri, 2014 https www.aeaweb.org articles?id 10.1257 mac.6.4.107 Fagereng et al., 2021 https www.aeaweb.org articles?id 10.1257 mac.20190211 Commault, 2022 https www.aeaweb.org articles?id 10.1257 mac.20190296 . Most empirical papers also find that households with little liquid wealth tend to have higher MPCs than households with a lot of liquid wealth. Models with income risk and a borrowing constraint like the one in Exercise 3 usually generate average annual MPCs lower than 30% if they are calibrated properly. 👉 Why are average MPCs in the data higher than in Aiyagari type models? Mention and explain at least 3 potential mechanisms that are not present in the model. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Answer Finite lifetimes can generate high MPCs among old households who do not have a strong bequest motive. A lot of wealth is illiquid, i.e. it can only be accessed if a transaction cost is paid housing or not all all pension wealth for young people . These illiquid assets typically pay higher returns than liquid assets. Therefore, many wealthy households might hold little liquid wealth and behave similarly to households who do not have any wealth at all. Kaplan and Violante, 2014 https onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi abs 10.3982 ECTA10528 In the model that we studied above, households end up in the low asset high MPC state solely due to bad luck. Preference heterogeneity might be an alternative mechanism since households that are impatient or have a high intertemporal elasticity of substition tend to have higher MPCs and less wealth than their peers. Gelman, 2021 https www.sciencedirect.com science article pii S0304393220300350 Aguiar et al., 2021 https www.nber.org papers w26643 Re computing the optimal consumption path after a small transitory income shock is a difficult task. Households may decide to follow a more simple rule e.g. spend small windfall gains completely if the associated utility loss is small compared to the computational cost of smoothing consumption.

Choose ``n`` parameters from the model. Set the parameter values so that the statistics in the model match those in the data. 👉 Discuss your choice. \"\"\" answer1 md\"\"\" I adopt y 1 as a normalization so that one unit of the consumption corresponds to the average annual income. The depreciation rate of housing \\delta and the length of the agents' lives J can be set according to external information. Moreover, the model defines the discount factor \\beta as \\beta 1 1 r and the real interest rate r can be set according to external information. So the only parameter which remains for internal calibration is the utility weight on housing services \\xi . If households place more weight on housing in their Cobb Douglas utility function, they will spend a larger share of their financial resources on housing. For a fixed depreciation rate \\delta and interest rate r , this means that they will buy larger houses. So the natural choice as the targeted moment is aggregate housing wealth aggregate income. I divide by aggregate income due to the y 1 normalization. With \\xi 0.094 instead of the old default value \\xi 0.113 , the chosen moment has almost the same value in the model as in the data. This means that a lot of information in the data is not used for calibration, e.g. net wealth income and debt income. You can still use these moments for model validation, i.e. to check whether the model is able to match moments which were not targeted during the calibration. As a side note, I find it a bit unsatisfying that the strength of the bequest motive cannot be calibrated in this model even though it is important for the relationship of MPCs with age stronger bequest motive less steep increase of MPCs with age . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Some words on calibration in general The decisions involved when calibrating a model can seem very arbitrary. For this reason, I'll briefly describe my approach to calibration. This is not necessarily the best way to do it. 1 Which parameter are set according to external information and which are calibrated \"internally\"? With internal calibration I mean to choose parameter values according to some method of moments algorithm. In my opinion, it makes a lot of sense to use external information to set parameter values whenever possible. The remaining parameters which need to be calibrated internally are often related to preferences. 2 Which moments should be selected for \"internal\" calibration? A good starting point is to pick moments such that each moment is particularly informative about one parameter. Of course, in the method of moments algorithm all moments determine jointly the parameter values. Moreover, models typically feature some type of normalization such as \"one unit of the consumption good is equal to the average annual income\". When selecting moments you need to take into account the normalization. \"\"\" model raw chain policies slider begin stack d, c, ph, h, y , π groupby variable combine value mean value, weights π NamedTuple tuple Symbol. .variable ... tuple .value... end model statistics ph model raw.ph model raw.y model statistics md\"\"\" Exercise 2 Housing Wealth Effects in an Aging Society 6 points Across many countries the demographic structure is changing. The figure below shows historical and forecast age structures for the USA. One notable feature of this figure is the hump that moves from left to right over time. This hump represents the generation of baby boomers . Given that age is an important determinant of housing wealth effects we want to ask the question How do aggregate housing wealth effects change as the society ages? \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 Aggregate response 3 points | Compute the aggregate consumption response to a 10% reduction in house prices for varying age structures. You can use `cres df` and `age weights`. \"\"\" md\"\"\" 👉 External validity 3 points | A politician asks you to forecast the consumption response to house price shock in 2030. Would you use the given model? Discuss some aspects of the real world that are missing from the model. The figure below provides two hints that you may pick up or ignore. \"\"\" answer2 md\"\"\" It is helpful to consider the Berger et al. 2018 formula which says that the consumption response to a house price shock is approximately the product of housing wealth and the MPC out of a transitory income shock ```math \\begin align \\frac dc it dp t p t \\approx p t h it MPC it \\end align ``` The response of aggregate consumption can therefore be written as ```math \\begin align \\frac dC t dp t p t \\sum i\\frac dc it dp t p t \\approx \\sum i p t h it MPC it \\end align ``` Using the approximation, we can see that the model is a good choice if ... 1 it captures the covariation of housing wealth with age well 2 it captures the covariation of MPCs with age well 1 The two figures below show that according to survey data older households tend to own more housing wealth than younger households, both because they are more likely to be homeowners and because they tend to live in more expensive houses conditional on being homeowners . In contrast, housing wealth is flat over the life cycle in the model. Therefore, the model might underestimate the effect of the demographic structure on the consumption response to house price shocks. Adding a rent vs. buy choice and a loan to value constraint to the model should help to match the data better. 2 The model predicts that MPCs increase with age, in particular among old retirees. It would be a good idea to find some empirical evidence regarding the relationship of MPCs with age to check if this is actually true. Moreover, it seems as if the average MPC in the model is much lower than in the empirical literature on MPCs. For this reason, it would make sense to add some model features which increase the overall level of MPCs, such as income risk and housing adjustment costs. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Appendix \"\"\" import CSV TableOfContents md\"\"\" Data \"\"\" md\"\"\" SCF \"\"\" const SCF YEARS 1989 3 2019 begin using DataDeps ENV \"DATADEPS ALWAYS ACCEPT\" true for year in SCF YEARS register DataDep \"SCF year \", \"\", \"https www.federalreserve.gov econres files scfp year excel.zip\", scf checksums year checksum Union String,Vector String ... , Optional, if not provided will generate post fetch method unpack end end function get scf year assert year ∈ SCF YEARS str \"SCF year \" path datadep str str CSV.File joinpath path, \"SCFP year .csv\" | DataFrame end data raw chain get scf 2019 begin stack INCOME, NETWORTH, ASSET, DEBT, NH MORT, HOUSES , WGT groupby variable combine value mean value, weights WGT NamedTuple tuple Symbol. .variable ... tuple .value... end data statistics ph data raw.HOUSES data raw.INCOME data statistics chain get scf 2019 begin transform age bin bycol cut AGE, weights WGT , 20 transform age bin Meta.parse get age bin groupby age bin combine \"house value\" mean HOUSES, weights WGT , \"ownership rate\" mean HOUSES . 0, weights WGT , age mean AGE, weights WGT stack \"house value\", \"ownership rate\" , age data mapping age, value \"\", row variable visual ScatterLines draw facet linkyaxes false end md\"\"\" Demographics TODO for 2023 reproducibly compile the data in the notebook \"\"\" import HTTP ages url \"https greimel.github.io distributional macroeconomics assets datasets age.csv\" age df0 CSV.File HTTP.get ages url .body | DataFrame age df chain age df0 begin subset year ∈ 1980 10 2040 transform age range from to select age range, share share length age range , year flatten age range rename age range age end chain age df begin subset year ∈ 1980 20 2040 groupby year combine age, pmf share, cdf cumsum share transform inverse cdf 1 cdf stack pmf, inverse cdf , age, year data mapping age, value \"\", row variable, color year nonnumeric visual Lines draw facet linkyaxes false aside Label .figure 0,1 , \"The age distribution over time\", tellwidth false end age weights chain age df begin subset year ∈ 1980 10 2040 subset age ∈ ages aside wgts80 sum subset , year 1980 .share transform raw share share, share share wgts80 end agg res chain age weights begin subset year 1980 leftjoin cres df, on age groupby year combine agg sum c res, weights share end scatterlines agg res.year, 100 agg res.agg, axis xlabel \"age distribution\", ylabel \"%\", title \"The Aggregate Response Given Demographic Change\" md\"\"\" Infrastructure \"\"\" function wordcount text stripped text strip replace string text , r\"\\s\" \" \" words split stripped text, ' ', ' ', '.', ',', ' ', ' ', '\"', ' ', ' ', '\\'' length filter \"\" , words end show words answer md\" approximately wordcount answer words \" begin admonition kind, title, text Markdown.MD Markdown.Admonition kind, title, text hint text, title \"Hint\" admonition \"hint\", title, text warning text, title \"Warning\" admonition \"warning\", title, text danger text, title \"Danger\" admonition \"danger\", title, text correct text, title \"Correct\" admonition \"correct\", title, text almost text warning text, \"Almost there \" keep working text md\"The answer is not quite right.\" danger text, \"Keep working on it \" yays md\"Great \", md\"Yay ❤\", md\"Great 🎉\", md\"Well done \", md\"Keep it up \", md\"Good job \", md\"Awesome \", md\"You got the right answer \", md\"Let's move on to the next section.\" got it text rand yays correct text, \"Got it \" end function show words limit answer, limit count wordcount answer if count 1.02 limit return show words answer else return almost md\"You are at count words.

The interest rate r round r,digits 4 is exogenous. The death probability is m which implies an expected lifetime as an adult of 1 m years. The income process has only two states y^1 y^2 and the transition matrix is symmetric. In this case, the probability \\rho to stay in the current income state completely determines the transition matrix. We assume that there is no income tax in the initial stationary equilibrium, i.e. T y 0 . With a probability of 50% a newborn household is born into the high income state. The distribution of assets of newborn households is uniform over the asset grid. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Solving the households' problem \"\"\" md\"\"\" To solve the households' problem, we treat the perpetual youth agents as infinitely lived agents with a modified discount factor \\tilde \\beta \\beta 1 m . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Stationary distribution \"\"\" md\"\"\" The ```QuantEcon``` framework gives us a matrix Q^ with transition probabilities from y, k to y', k' for households that do not die in between periods.

However, the plot also shows that agents who are born into the high income state are better off. 👉 How is this possible? \"\"\" md\"\"\" The introduction of the redistributive income tax has two effects on the agent in the high income state 1. Current net income and expected future net incomes decrease 2. Income risk in the future decreases The first effect decreases the value function in the high income state, the second effect increases it the agents dislike income risk . It depends on the parameter values which of the two effects is more important quantitatively. \"\"\" md\"\"\" \"\"\" md\"\"\" In order to quantify the welfare changes due to the income tax, we need to transform the differences in the value functions into units of the consumption good. First, we need to make a few definitions The value function in the stationary equilibrium without the reform is ```math \\begin align V k 1 , y 0 & \\operatorname E 0\\Bigl \\sum t 0 ^\\infty \\beta^t 1 m ^t u c k t 1 , y t \\Bigr \\\\ &\\begin aligned \\text subject to &k t k t 1 1 r y t c k t 1 , y t \\\\ \\end aligned \\end align ``` The value function in the stationary equilibrium with the reform is ```math \\begin align V \\tau k 1 , y 0 & \\operatorname E 0\\Bigl \\sum t 0 ^\\infty \\beta^t 1 m ^t u c \\tau k t 1 , y t \\Bigr \\\\ &\\begin aligned \\text subject to &k t k t 1 1 r y t T y t c \\tau k t 1 , y t \\\\ \\end aligned \\end align ``` where c k,y is optimal consumption in the stationary equilibrium without the reform and c \\tau k, y is the optimal consumption in the stationary equilibrium with the reform. If consumption in the stationary equilibrium without the reform is increased by a fraction \\Delta in each state of the world, the sum of expected utilities becomes ```math \\begin align W k 1 , y 0 \\Delta & \\operatorname E 0\\Bigl \\sum t 0 ^\\infty \\beta^t 1 m ^t u 1 \\Delta c k t 1 , y t \\Bigr \\\\ &\\begin aligned \\text subject to &k t k t 1 1 r y t c k t 1 , y t \\\\ \\end aligned \\end align ``` Note that we do not allow the agent to reoptimize with respect to the relative consumption increase \\Delta in the definition of W k, y \\Delta . We can finally define the conditional welfare change for an agent born into state k,y as the relative increase in consumption \\Delta k,y in the stationary equilibrium without the reform that makes the agent as well off as in the stationary equilibrium with the reform V \\tau k,y W k,y \\Delta k,y \"\"\" md\"\"\" \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 2 Formula for CRRA utility Usually the equation above needs to be solved numerically for \\Delta k,y .

But if some agents lose and others gain, simply computing conditional welfare changes is not sufficient to understand whether a certain tax policy is desirable.

The income process has only two states y^1 y^2 and the transition matrix is symmetric. In this case, the probability \\rho to stay in the current income state completely determines the transition matrix. We assume that there is no income tax in the initial stationary equilibrium, i.e. T y 0 . With a probability of 50% a newborn household is born into the high income state. The distribution of assets of newborn households is uniform over the asset grid. \"\"\" md\"\"\" Solving the households' problem \"\"\" md\"\"\" To solve the households' problem, we treat the perpetual youth agents as infinitely lived agents with a modified discount factor \\tilde \\beta \\beta 1 m . \"\"\" md\"\"\" Stationary distribution \"\"\" md\"\"\" The ```QuantEcon``` framework gives us a matrix Q^ with transition probabilities from y, k to y', k' for households that do not die in between periods.

First, we need to make a few definitions The value function in the stationary equilibrium without the reform is ```math \\begin align V k 1 , y 0 & \\operatorname E 0\\Bigl \\sum t 0 ^\\infty \\beta^t 1 m ^t u c k t 1 , y t \\Bigr \\\\ &\\begin aligned \\text subject to &k t k t 1 1 r y t c k t 1 , y t \\\\ \\end aligned \\end align ``` The value function in the stationary equilibrium with the reform is ```math \\begin align V \\tau k 1 , y 0 & \\operatorname E 0\\Bigl \\sum t 0 ^\\infty \\beta^t 1 m ^t u c \\tau k t 1 , y t \\Bigr \\\\ &\\begin aligned \\text subject to &k t k t 1 1 r y t T y t c \\tau k t 1 , y t \\\\ \\end aligned \\end align ``` where c k,y is optimal consumption in the stationary equilibrium without the reform and c \\tau k, y is the optimal consumption in the stationary equilibrium with the reform. If consumption in the stationary equilibrium without the reform is increased by a fraction \\Delta in each state of the world, the sum of expected utilities becomes ```math \\begin align W k 1 , y 0 \\Delta & \\operatorname E 0\\Bigl \\sum t 0 ^\\infty \\beta^t 1 m ^t u 1 \\Delta c k t 1 , y t \\Bigr \\\\ &\\begin aligned \\text subject to &k t k t 1 1 r y t c k t 1 , y t \\\\ \\end aligned \\end align ``` Note that we do not allow the agent to reoptimize with respect to the relative consumption increase \\Delta in the definition of W k, y \\Delta . We can finally define the conditional welfare change for an agent born into state k,y as the relative increase in consumption \\Delta k,y in the stationary equilibrium without the reform that makes the agent as well off as in the stationary equilibrium with the reform V \\tau k,y W k,y \\Delta k,y \"\"\" md\"\"\" \"\"\" md\"\"\" Exercise 2 Formula for CRRA utility Usually the equation above needs to be solved numerically for \\Delta k,y .

But if some agents lose and others gain, simply computing conditional welfare changes is not sufficient to understand whether a certain tax policy is desirable. For this purpose, we need to define a welfare function to aggregate the maximized utility among the newborn agents. We choose a utilitarian welfare function here V \\sum y\\in\\ y^1, y^2\\ \\int k \\min ^\\infty V k,y \\pi 0 k,y dk Since we only consider newborn agents, we integrate with respect to the distribution \\pi 0 and not with respect to the stationary distribution \\pi .
