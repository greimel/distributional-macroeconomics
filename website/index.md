# _Topics in Distributional Macroeconomics_

 This website hosts some of the material for the PhD-level course _Topics in Distributional Macroeconomics_ at the Tinbergen Institute Amsterdam. The corresponding Github repository is [here](https://github.com/greimel/distributional-macroeconomics).

 The first edition of the course was in Spring 2022. Nevertheless, much of the material is unfinished.
